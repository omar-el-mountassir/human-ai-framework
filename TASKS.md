# Human-AI Interaction Framework Tasks

This document serves as the central task management system for the Human-AI Interaction Framework project. It provides a structured approach to track, prioritize, and manage all project tasks.

## Task Workflow

Tasks follow this workflow:

1. **Backlog** → Tasks that have been identified but not yet prioritized
2. **To Do** → Prioritized tasks ready to be worked on
3. **In Progress** → Tasks currently being actively worked on
4. **Review** → Tasks completed but awaiting verification/review
5. **Done** → Tasks that are fully completed and verified

## Task Format

Each task should include:

- **ID**: Unique identifier (e.g., HAIF-123)
- **Title**: Concise description of the task
- **Description**: Detailed explanation of requirements
- **Priority**: Critical, High, Medium, Low
- **Component**: Core, Models, Services, Utils, CLI, Testing, Docs
- **Assignee**: Person responsible for the task
- **Due Date**: Target completion date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- **Status**: Backlog, To Do, In Progress, Review, Done
- **Dependencies**: IDs of tasks that must be completed first
- **Labels**: Additional categorizations (e.g., bug, enhancement)

## Prioritization Strategy

Tasks are prioritized based on these factors:

1. **Impact**: How significant is the value provided by completing the task?
2. **Urgency**: How time-sensitive is the task?
3. **Effort**: How much work is required to complete the task?
4. **Dependencies**: Does this task block other important tasks?

## Weekly Review Process

Every Monday, the team should:

1. Review completed tasks and move verified ones to Done
2. Update status of in-progress tasks
3. Re-prioritize the backlog based on current project needs
4. Assign new tasks from the To Do list

## Accountability

To ensure no tasks fall through the cracks:

1. Each task must have a clear assignee when moved to In Progress
2. Tasks in Review must be verified within 3 business days
3. Tasks without progress for 5 business days should be flagged for discussion
4. Weekly review meetings must address all flagged tasks

## Task Creation Guidelines

When creating new tasks:

1. Search first to avoid duplication
2. Use clear, specific titles
3. Provide detailed descriptions with acceptance criteria
4. Identify dependencies upfront
5. Suggest an initial priority level

This task management system should be updated regularly to reflect the current state of the project. All team members are responsible for keeping their assigned tasks up-to-date.
